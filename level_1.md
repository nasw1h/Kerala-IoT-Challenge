## Experiment 1 - Hello World LED Blinking

> A basic Program similar to printing "*Hello World* " in any programming language. The Aim is to blink an LED using **Arduino Uno Board**.

> Arduino Uno is an open-source microcontroller board developed by Arduino.cc. It has several advantages over the conventional microcontrollers. It comes with a pre-tested software and hardware libraries and has its own integrated development environment (IDE). Also it is less expensive & beginner friendly.
